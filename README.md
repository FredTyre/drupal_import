# drupal_import
Tools for automating migration between versions of drupal. Implemented using Python. Uses Selenium as part of the automation process. It will generate popup windows of a new Chrome Browser window for each piece of new content being added. Uses drupal to create drupal content (only its automated). Therefore it also requires creating an automation user that has enough permissions on the new site to create the new content.

Intended to import from XML files generated by drupal_import (https://github.com/One5hot76/drupal_import).
Requires database access to the websites where data is being exported.
Requires the version of ChromeDriver that matches the person running drupal_import's Chrome Browser version.
